## Setting up an Angular2 application which uses ExpressJS (Written in Typescript using Visual Studio Code)

Documenting the steps which I had to go through inorder to get an Angular2+ExpressJS+Typescript application up and running using Visual Studio Code. The final project will be made available as a seed project in github.

### Pre-requisites
1. Visual Studio Code
2. NodeJS
3. NPM
4. Typescript


##Setting up the Project

Create a folder with the name of your project (eg:XprssNg2TSSeed)

Open the project in VSCode.(ie. Open the folder in VSCode)

It is always useful to open the terminal/cmd along with it, since we will be running many command line tools to get the tools and packages required for the project.
